# Ulam Spiral

This program generates an Ulam Spiral, a visualization of prime numbers in a spiral pattern. It uses Java Swing to create a graphical user interface (GUI) window for displaying the spiral. üåÄ

## Usage

1. Run the program. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
2. A dialog box will prompt you to enter the size of the spiral. üî¢
3. Enter a positive integer value to determine the size of the spiral. The larger the size, the more prime numbers will be displayed.
4. The program will open a window titled "Ulam Spiral" displaying the generated spiral. ü™ê
5. Each prime number in the spiral is represented by a small square filled in the graphical interface. üü©

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed ‚òï
- Java Swing library

## How it works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the size of the spiral using a dialog box.
2. The `Main` class extends the `JFrame` class to create a window for the spiral.
3. The window is centered on the screen and sized according to the user's input.
4. The `paint` method is overridden to draw the spiral.
5. The prime numbers are determined using the `isPrime` method, which checks if a number is divisible by any number from 2 up to the square root of the number.
6. The `Graphics` object is used to draw the prime numbers as small squares on the spiral.
7. The spiral is generated by moving in a clockwise direction, changing direction at each "turn" and incrementing the step size.
8. The `dx` and `dy` variables control the movement of the spiral in the x and y directions, respectively.
9. The `angle` variable keeps track of the current angle of movement in degrees.
10. The loop continues until all the cells in the spiral are processed.

## Note

- If the user enters an invalid input or closes the dialog box without entering a value, a default size of 100 is used for the spiral.

Feel free to customize and experiment with the program to explore different sizes and variations of the Ulam Spiral. ‚ú®
